# Bambu Bootstrap

Use Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) CSS framework to build your app. All the views Bambu uses all extend a base template which you create, that can be based on a skeleton Bootstrap template. Shortcut tags let you easily add breadcrumb trails and icons to your apps.
